                <h2>The Art of the Curve</h2>
                <p>Creating a smooth, flowing curve in steel requires more than just brute force. It requires mechanical rollers and a keen eye for geometry. Many inexperienced installers leave "kinks" or flat spots in the curve, ruining the effect.</p>
                
                <h3>No Pre-Fabricated Rings</h3>
                <p>While we sell rings, our premium installation service involves <strong>continuous curving onsite</strong>. This means we can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow the exact dripline of your existing trees.</li>
                    <li>Create "kidney" shapes or serpentine paths that navigate through obstacles.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the radius on the fly to suit the visual weight of the garden.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Ideal Use Cases</h2>
                <p>Curved edging is particularly effective in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Coastal Gardens:</strong> Mimicking the rolling dunes and waves of the Bass Coast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bush Blocks:</strong> Softening the harsh lines of a house against a native gum backdrop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pathway Definition:</strong> Guiding the eye (and the visitor) towards a front door or garden feature.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical Precision</h3>
                <p>We use 1.6mm or 2.0mm gauge steel for curves, as it offers the perfect balance of flexibility and strength. Once pegged, the tension in the steel holds the curve rigid, preventing it from warping over time.</p>
