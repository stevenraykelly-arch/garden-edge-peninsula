                <h2>Why Choose Our Steel?</h2>
                <p>Not all "rusty metal" is genuine Corten. Many cheap imports are simply mild steel that creates a flakey, destructive rust that eventually eats through the metal. <strong>Garden Edge</strong> supplies only genuine weathering steel (often referred to by the trademark Cor-Ten).</p>
                <p>Our steel develops a stable, protective oxide layer that resists corrosion, ensuring your garden borders last for decades, not just seasons.</p>

                <h3>Available Sizes & Specifications</h3>
                <p>We stock a range of gauges and heights to suit every application, from decorative flower beds to structural retaining:</p>

                    <li><strong>Heavy Duty Pegs:</strong> Twisted or ribbed steel pegs that lock the edging into heavy clay or sandy loam.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corner Pieces:</strong> Prefabricated 90-degree internal and external corners for sharp, geometric designs.</li>
                </ul>
