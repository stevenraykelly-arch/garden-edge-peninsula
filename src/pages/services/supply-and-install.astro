                <h2>The Installation Difference</h2>
                <p>While DIY is an option, achieving a dead-straight line or a perfectly smooth curve requires experience and the right tools. Our team specializes exclusively in edging. We don't just "dig a trench"; we engineer a border that stays put.</p>

                <h3>Our Process</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Site Prep & Levels:</strong> We use rotary laser levels to ensure your edging is perfectly horizontal (or follows the natural fall of the land, depending on drainage requirements).</li>
                    <li><strong>Trenching:</strong> We excavate a clean trench, removing roots and debris that causes edging to lift over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pegging & Fixing:</strong> Using extra-long commercial steel pegs, we anchor the edging deep into the sub-soil. We weld or screw connect lengths for a seamless finish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backfilling:</strong> We backfill both sides of the edge to lock it in place before you add your soil or pebbles.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Challenges We Solve</h3>
                <p>The Mornington Peninsula has diverse soil types. In <strong>Rye and Sorrento</strong>, the sandy soil shifts easily. We use specialized 600mm jagged pegs to grip the sand. In <strong>Mt Eliza and Red Hill</strong>, the clay can shrink and swell. We use expansion joints to prevent the steel from buckling under pressure.</p>

                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lawn Barriers:</strong> Keep your Kikuyu or Buffalo grass out of your garden beds permanently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retaining Walls:</strong> Low-level retaining (up to 300mm) to level out sloping coastal blocks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Driveway Borders:</strong> Define your crushed rock or pebble driveway with a crisp, rusty edge that withstands vehicle tyre knocks.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>"The team transformed our messy sloping block in Dromana into three neat terraced levels using the 200mm Corten edging. It looks architectural and amazing." - <strong>Tom & Jen, Dromana</strong></p>
